      Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) is an official version of Firefox
      developed for large organizations like universities and businesses that need to
      set up and maintain Firefox on a large scale.  Firefox ESR does not come with
      the latest features but it has the latest security and stability fixes.

      - title: Allowing the membarrier System Call
        level: 2
        content: |-
          To properly work, recent versions of {{ app.friendly_name }} need the
          `membarrier` system call.  Without it, tabs would frequently crash.

          Docker uses [seccomp profile] to restrict system calls available to the
          container.  Before Docker version `20.10.0`, the `membarrier` system call was
          not allowed in the default profile.  If you run a such version, you can use one
          of the following solutions, from the most to the least secure, to provide the
          container permission to use this sytem call:

            1. Run the container with a custom seccomp profile allowing the `membarrier`
               system call.  The [latest official seccomp profile] can be used.  Download
               the file and then add the following parameter when creating the container:
               `--security-opt seccomp=/path/to/seccomp_profile.json`.
            2. Run the container without the default seccomp profile (thus allowing all
               system calls). Use the following parameter when creating the container:
               `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`.
            3. Run the container in privileged mode.  This effectively disables usage of
               seccomp.  Add the `--privileged` parameter when creating the container.

      - title: Sound Support
        level: 2
        content: |-
          For {{ app.friendly_name }} to be able to use the audio device available on
          the host, `/dev/snd` must be exposed to the container by adding the
          `--device /dev/snd` parameter to the `docker run` command.
      - title: Setting {{ app.friendly_name }} Preferences Via Environment Variables
        level: 2
        content: |-
          {{ app.friendly_name }} preferences can be set via environment variables
          passed to the container.  During the startup, a script process all these
          variables and modify the preference file accordingly.

          The name of the environment variable must start with `FF_PREF_`, followed by a
          string of your choice.  For example, `FF_PREF_MY_PREF` is a valid name.

          The content of the variable should be in the format `NAME=VAL`, where `NAME` is
          the name of the preference (as found in the `about:config` page) and `VAL` is
          its value.  A value can be one of the following types:
            - string
            - integer
            - boolean

          It is important to note that a value of type `string` should be surrounded by
          double quotes.  Other types don't need them.

          For example, to set the `network.proxy.http` preference, one would pass the
          environment variable to the container by adding the following argument to the
          `docker run` command:

          ```
          -e "FF_PREF_HTTP_PROXY=network.proxy.http=\"proxy.example.com\""
          ```

          If a preference needs to be *removed*, its value should be set to `UNSET`.  For
          example:

          ```
          -e "FF_PREF_HTTP_PROXY=network.proxy.http=UNSET"
          ```

          **NOTE**: This is an advanced usage and it is recommended to set preferences
          via {{ app.friendly_name }} directly.

          If {{ app.friendly_name }} is crashing frequently, make sure that:
            - The `membarrier` system call is not blocked by Docker.  See the
              [Allowing the membarrier System Call](#allowing-the-membarrier-system-call)
              for more details.
            - Make sure the kernel of your Linux distribution is up-to-date.
